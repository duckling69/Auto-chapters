00:00:00
welcome to guest the language a show
00:00:01
where we guess the languages from around
00:00:03
the world and today we're going to Asia
00:00:05
explain the rules this is guest the
00:00:07
language Asia Edition someone will walk
00:00:09
in and say a line in their native
00:00:11
language it's me S our two teams will
00:00:13
then be able to ask one question each
00:00:15
and then they have to pin where they
00:00:16
think the language is from on the map
00:00:18
behind them for the catch is some of the
00:00:19
languages might be absolute waffle for
00:00:22
every language you get right is three
00:00:23
points or if both teams get it wrong
00:00:25
it's one point for the closest guess but
00:00:27
now let's introduce the teams yes my
00:00:29
peop I'm back I'm here with a a better
00:00:32
teammate we called East to the West now
00:00:34
I'm from East Africa he's from West
00:00:36
Africa so it makes sense the Dream Team
00:00:38
baby we are the invincibles cuz we've
00:00:40
never lost never lost we just win yeah
00:00:43
we're like sponges we just absorb yeah y
00:00:48
let's go with that let's go invincibles
00:00:51
AKA sponges how do you guys feel that
00:00:53
you're going to get smoked again well
00:00:54
that's not happening cuz I'm here I feel
00:00:56
like I've got the knowledge to help you
00:00:58
today at the end of the day I'm going to
00:00:59
put Faith on my my partner until he

he saying a bit like towards the end not
00:14:19
fully it's like it changes a bit we
00:14:20
haven't had a waffle yet that's why I'm
00:14:23
thinking now this one might be the
00:14:24
waffle one okay can I I have my question

Lang trust me it will help me cuz he'll
00:14:37
struggle why why will he
00:14:39
struggle you can just say the name uh
00:14:42
what football team do you support could
00:14:43

blah
00:14:56
oh okay cool uh I've got a question ask

00:15:01
your language how do you say I love
00:15:06
you he's thinking so
00:15:10
much
00:15:13

00:15:16
guys ready to vote thank you thank my
00:15:18
friend just just trust me trust me at
00:15:20
the end of that round deji and I
00:15:21
confidently locked in Waffle no I back
00:15:23
it I back it every single one he was
00:15:25
thinking he was thinking hard me
00:15:27
personally I was going here yeah right
00:15:30
yeah but based off that answer chunks
00:15:32
and Kenny also thought he was waffling
00:15:35
same thing baby my opinion is that he is
00:15:37
South Korean but when he struggled to
00:15:39
say I love you that's when I was like
00:15:40
okay cuz for me I love you is sang
00:15:42
that's pretty easy to just say why do
00:15:44
you know how to say I love you so many
00:15:45
cuz I watch K-pop okay fa I watch K
00:15:47
dramas I know you guys like toi Kimi you
00:15:50
like come on brother that's only if he
00:15:51
is South Korean he might not be South
00:15:53
Korean he does look Korean and and I
00:15:56
think I've seen him before as well I
00:15:57
think you're just a troll and that he
00:15:59
does speak South Korean but but he's
00:16:01
given us waffle that's my opinion okay
00:16:04
so my friend well we've guessed that you
00:16:06
were saying waffle song Jay what was the
00:16:09
language you were speaking all right W
00:16:18
[Applause]
00:16:19
Mand Mand going to get chicken and
00:16:22
mandom that was bad joke SP are your
00:16:25
crabs are safe farm so what are we
00:16:26
speaking W mandom Chen Anders in
00:16:30
yeah he was waffling waffling so I am
00:16:33
originally from South Korea but I was
00:16:35
waffling

00:17:44
other language mahad is great so I could

00:18:23
marry me that
00:18:25
says he didn't say that at all okay
00:18:28

a risk but it's a good risk you you
00:18:37

okay all right then trust me trust me on
00:19:23
this so chunks and Kenny locked in
00:19:25
Pakistan as their country meanwhile
00:19:27
myself and deji were still debating with
00:19:29
each other chun's uh question he said
00:19:32
the same he said something different
00:19:34
completely completely as W I promise you
00:19:37

India okay should we should we should we
00:19:53
should we give our little while we think
00:19:54
I'll be honest with you this one is the
00:19:55
one that I've been least comfortable
00:19:57
about right in but when I said to you
00:19:59
will you marry me I'd say it as muadi
00:20:01
kogi which is Hindi but you could be
00:20:03
speaking Udu I think it might be
00:20:04
Pakistan but I could be wrong my Logic
00:20:06
for India is there are so many dialects
00:20:07
I heard in India they speak I guess 600
00:20:10

00:21:39
that this section here haven't really
00:21:41
been in any wars in the last 25 years
00:21:43
but Rock has in the last 25 years ask
00:21:46
like have they been in a war in the last
00:21:48
25 years yeah cuz this is what's the
00:21:50
technical thing cuz I know she's being
00:21:52
Arabic but it's about where she's from
00:21:54
Iranians speak Persian Iraqis speak
00:21:58
Arabic or Kurdish but then look she
00:22:00
could be Syrian Jord Jordanian I I don't
00:22:03
know I'm not well knowledged on the Arab
00:22:06
the world you guys called for us to ask
00:22:07

Kenny eventually locked in Iraq you know
00:23:35
what I'm I'm a I'm going leave the
00:23:36

00:24:16
for this one you CH wins now you the
00:24:20
fact that we were also thinking on that
00:24:21
one as well okay my logic yeah Marhaba
00:24:25
Arabic Marhaba is basic that's what she
00:24:27
said at the beginning that basically
00:24:28
means like greetings I think Iraqis
00:24:30
speak Kurdish but also Arabic and the
00:24:33
fact that my two next neighbors were
00:24:34
from kurala which is in Iraq so I
00:24:36
thought she looks similar aesthetically
00:24:38
to my next door neighbor marwa she looks
00:24:40
very similar to them I think yeah she's
00:24:42
a Iraqi it is all down to this
